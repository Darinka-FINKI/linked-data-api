This is an experimental implementation of the RDF to JSON encoder
and decoder as discussed in:
http://code.google.com/p/linked-data-api/wiki/DI_expimental_translator

The code includes a Maven POM file defining the dependencies on Jena
and related artifacts. If you have m2eclipse installed then importing this
as an Eclipse project should automatically download the dependencies
and add them to the project classpath.
