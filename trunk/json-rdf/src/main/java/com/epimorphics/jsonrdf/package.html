Provides encoding of RDF resources, models or DataSets into a developer-friendly
JSON form and decoding of the generated format back into RDF. Round-tripping is
not guaranteed in all cases but is is possible in most cases if properties are used with consistent
ranges.
</p>
<p>The typical usage is:</p>
<pre>
Encoder.get().encode(model, resourcesList, writer)
</pre>
<p>
which uses a default set of encoding rules and no context information. Mapping
information can be specified by means of a Context object:</p>
<pre>
Context context = new Context([baseURL], [ontologyModel]);
Encoder.get(context).encode(...);
</pre>
<p>
The ontologyModel provides default label mappings for properties and can
tag properties to be hidden or treated as multivalued. See <a href="http://epimorph-pubx1.appspot.com/help.html#ontology">help file</a>.</p>
<p>The other <code>Encoder.get()</code> options allow specification of a set of encoding rules
via an EncoderPlugin. This is just to ease experimentation during development and the
option is likely to be removed once the rules settle down. </p>
