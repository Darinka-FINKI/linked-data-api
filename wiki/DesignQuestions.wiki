#summary Summary of design questions and resolutions so far

This is an attempt to break the problem down into a series of design decisions where we can test how much agreement there is on each.

The current breakdown is probably not right and certainly not complete. The summary of status is probably wrong in many cases. Please improve.

All references to _round-tripping_ in the design issues are subject to the caveat that our aims place inverting the mapping back to RDF as non-requirement, just an added bonus. However, where round-tripping breaks that does mean the mapping is ambiguous and that might impact some applications even when full inversion isn't involved.
