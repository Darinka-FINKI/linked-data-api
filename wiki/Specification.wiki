#summary Linked Data API Specification

This document defines a vocabulary and processing model for a configurable API layer intended to support the creation of simple RESTful APIs over RDF triple stores. 

The API layer is intended to be deployed as a proxy in front of a SPARQL endpoint to support:

  * Generation of documents (information resources) for the publishing of Linked Data
  * Provision of sophisticated querying and data extraction features, without the need for end-users to write SPARQL queries
  * Delivery of multiple output formats from these APIs, including a simple serialisation of RDF in JSON syntax

==Document Conventions==

The examples used in this document assume that the following namespaces have been defined, unless otherwise states

||rdf||`http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#`||

API configuration examples use the Turtle syntax for readability in the specification. This is not meant to constrain the syntaxes supported by implementations.
