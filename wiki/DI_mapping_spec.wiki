#summary Design issues - Specifying the mapping

== Specifying the mapping ==

In cases where the publisher (and, potentially the consumer for sophisticated consumers) wants to override the default mappings there should be a declarative format for defining the mapping.  This format should be expressed in RDF? JSON? ad hoc API parameters?

*Status:* Jeni proposes using RDF for this at least at the publisher end, Mark uses JSON when mapping the other way.
