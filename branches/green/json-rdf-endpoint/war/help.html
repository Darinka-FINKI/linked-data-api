<h1>Experimental RDF result set to JSON translator</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This page provides an experimental RDF to JSON translator as discussed on the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/linked-data-api/">linked-data-api wiki</a>.
The aim, eventually, is to support a JSON-based publishing format for 
RDF that is optimised for approachability for normal developers. </p>

<p>
It is not intended as a general RDF syntax. In particular, round tripping from RDF through
the JSON format and back again is not guaranteed. It will work in the simple 80% of cases.
The format includes a <em>context</em> block which records information on the ranges for
properties. In cases where a property is used uniformly (object value is always a simple resources,
or always a list or always a literal) then round tripping is supported.</p> 

<p>
The design choices for the JSON format are still under discussion. This translator
is intended to make it easy to experiment with the current set of choices to
see what it looks like. It will be updated as the design is refined.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Paste some source RDF into the text area, select the format (Turtle, RDF/XML and N-triple
are supported) and click <em>As JSON</em> to get the translated version. The translation
includes a wrapper object giving the format version information and a <em>context</em>
object to enable round tripping. The translated RDF is in the <em>results</em> array. </p>

<pre class="box">
{
  "format":"linked-data-api",
  "version":"0.0",
  "results":[
    { ... RDF is here ... }
  ],
  "context":{ ... }
}</pre>

<p>In the API itself you can specify a list of root resources to be serialized and
the <em>results</em> field will comprise those resources, in order. The web form
does not yet support explicit specification of the roots, instead all unique subjects in the source RDF graph
will be serialized in a pseudo-random order.</p>

<p>The <em>Pretty print</em> option causes the returned JSON to be indented to make it
easy to read.</p>

<p>If a base URL is given then all resource references which extensions of
that base URL will be return as relative references and the <em>context</em>
block will include the base URL.</p>

<a name="ontology"></a><h2>Ontology-based configuration</h2></a>
<p>
An RDF graph can be serialized with no additional configuration information. 
Short names for properties will be chosen based on label information in the graph
or using the local name.</p>

<p>Optionally a separate ontology can be given which provides label information for
properties and, optionally, additional configuration information. The only statements 
in the ontology that the translator will pay attention to are:</p>

<pre class="box">
:property rdfs:label "label" .
</pre>
<p>
used to given a short form name to the property when serialized, only applies if the label is an NCName.</p>

<pre class="box">
:property a lda:Hidden .
</pre>
<p>
used to mark a property to be excluded from the serialization.</p>

<pre class="box">
:property a lda:Multivalued .
</pre>
<p>
used to mark a property to be always serialized as multivalued (i.e. as a JSON array) irrespective 
of how many object values it has in any given instance. Without this marker then a property will be
serialized as a simple value or an array according to the cardinality of the instance data.</p> 

<p>
where the namespaces are:
<pre class="box">
@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; .
@prefix lda: &lt;http://www.epimorphics.com/vocabularies/lda#&gt; .</pre>
 </p>

<h2>Programmatic access</h2>
<p>
This service can be called via a simple POST with the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>source</b> the source of the RDF graph in the selected format</li>
<li><b>format</b> the format of the RDF graph source</li>
<li><b>base</b> optional base URI</li>
<li><b>PrettyPrint</b> optional, set to "true" if pretty pretty is desired</li>
<li><b>ontologyUsed</b> optional, set to "true" if a configuration ontology is supplied</li>
<li><b>ontology</b> the source of the configuration ontology graph in the selected format</li>
<li><b>callback</b> optional, JSONP prefix to prepend to result to support cross-domain usage</li>
</ul>

<p>It call also be used in proxy mode by doing a GET with the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>url</b> URL from which the fetch the RDF data</li>
<li><b>PrettyPrint</b> optional, set to "true" if pretty pretty is desired</li>
<li><b>callback</b> optional, JSONP prefix to prepend to result to support cross-domain usage</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that for the instance which is hosted on Google App Engine then there is a GAE-imposed 30s limit on responses.
If the proxied RDF source cannot delivery the complete RDF graph in that time the request will timeout (returning
an HTML error page).</p>
