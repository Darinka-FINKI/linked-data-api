This is a simple servlet to support experimenting with the RDF/JSON converter.

Currently has a POST interface and form to enable interactive checks and a 
proxy mode to allow a GET on a public RDF data set as JSON.

This is set up as a Google App Engine project and uses SNAPSHOT versions of ARQ 
and Jena that are GAE compatible.

The SVN includes lib files which is bad practice these days but I couldn't get
m2eclipse and the GAE sdk to coexist well enough to get round this.
